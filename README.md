# Perfect Forwarding in `C++`

___

Studying the concept of __perfect forwarding__ in `C++`.
Based on a YT video which can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjBj7-VjY4)


## June 2020 Update

Simple source on **forwarding** and **moving** expressions.

There is a nice presentation on YT (can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe0lypOO3x4&list=LLD8ArTGhWPeTeiLqVFxcDlg&index=6&t=0s))

* It contains information about the concept of *universal references*.
* More details can be seen in [this](PerfectForwardingC++) note.

Sources:

1. Great blog post on `forwarding` written by Scott Meyers:  [C++14 Lambdas and Perfect Forwarding](docs/c14-lambdas-and-perfect-forwarding.html).
2. Another source from *open-std* [](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2009/n2951.html)
3. Interesting discussion on the overloading of `forward` operator. [What is the purpose of std::forward()'s rvalue reference overload?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56361755/what-is-the-purpose-of-stdforwards-rvalue-reference-overload)

*Obs:* Also, there is a Roam Research page dedicated to the topic of **Perfect Forwarding**.
